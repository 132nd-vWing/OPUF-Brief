## Situation
The last year there have been increasing tension in the Persian Gulf. The US have increased sanctions to IRAN, and IRAN have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz.

Intelligence indicate that IRAN is working with RUSSIA and CHINA in order to aquire new weaponsystems, such as aircraft and SAM's. It is in both RUSSIA and CHINA's interest to inflict damage to the allied coalition through IRAN as its proxy.

From december 2010 UAE and OMAN have seen an increasing activity from the insurgent group "Alsyf Albarq" (Lightening Sword) that are affiliated with IRAN and its goal is for IRAN to seize control of OMAN so that the people of OMAN and IRAN can be united as a single country.

In addition to the insurgent group Alsayf Albarq (AA), a terror organization by the name of "Al Kahn Brigade" has emerged and have conducted several terror attacks in both UAE and OMAN.

Recently there have been indications that IRAN are preparing a offensive, but currently, intelligence do not have any good assessments based on lack of reporting.


In May 2011 a US led Combined Joint Task Force, CJTF-87, was invited to come to UAE in order to function as a deterrence for any Iran provocations. CJTF-87 operates in UAE and OMAN in order to reassurce the people of UAE and Oman that the allies is on their side of the conflict.

CJTF-87 mission have three parts:
1. Deter IRAN aggression.
2. Counterinsurgency (COIN) against Alsyf Albarq.
3. Counterterrorism (CT) against Al Kahn Brigade.
CJTF is invited in by UAE and OMAN, and operates in both countries.

CJTF-87 is heavily reliant on air forces, as the build-up of major land forces takes time.
