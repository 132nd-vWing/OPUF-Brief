#  Ground Forces Doctrine

The Iranian Ground Forces operate in accordance with the following doctrine:

The Iranian have a Russian based military force. The primary elements for conducting major military operations are Regiments.
Supporting the maneouver regiments are various other units such as artillery battalion, Rocket artillery battalion, Recon company, Logistical Battalions
In addition the Regiments will normally be attached an Air Defence Battalion to protect against air threats [See: Air Defence Doctrine](Air_Defence_Doctrine.MD)



<br>
<br>
## Regiment

The Iranians have 3 standard maneuverregiments:

- Armored Regiment: Main Battle Tanks (MBT's) as the primary weapon. 
- Mechanized Infantry Regiment: Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV's) as the primary weapon.
- Motorized Infantry Regiment: Armored Personell Carriers (APC's) as the primary weapon.


The Armoured Regiments are considered the primary fighting force for offensive operations, and will normally be conserved as much as possible for counterattacks
or offensive operations.

All three types of regiments can conduct both offensive and defensive operations, however, the Motorized Infantry Regiments are not well suited for offensive operations
and is normally only used for defensive operations, or supporting the other regiments.


Each Regiment consist of 2 maneuver Battalions (with MBT, IFV or APC), the Regiment will also have a artillery battery attached in direct support, the Regiment 
is led by a Regimental HQ platoon.


<br>
<br>
## Reconnaissance Company

Recon Companys have specially trained personell to call in airstrikes, artillery or collect intelligence.
Recon units work in smaller units, and relies on not getting detected while doing their missions. The Recon units are normally
supporting other units, either in direct support (attached to a specific unit) or in general support (providing ad-hoc support).

A Recon Company is broken down into 3 platoons.

Each platoon have 3 teams. Of the 3 teams, 2x teams are equipped with Land Rovers, while the last team is recon team of soldiers without a vehicles. 

The last team normally inserts via helicopter, walking, or other non-traditional insertion methods.

## Logistical Battalion



<br>
<br>
### Tactics
The manuever regiments are the frontline forces and conduct the heavy fighting.

For offensive operations the artillery battalion or rocket artillery battalions will be supporting the maneuver regiment by conducting SHAPING fires
prior to the attack, and by providing fires during the offensive.

Prior to offensive operations the manuever regiment will be supplied from logistical battalions. 

For defensive operations, the artillery battery attached to the regiments will support with necessary fires. 

For defensive operations the support platoons organic to the maneuver battalions will support with necessary logistics.



<br>
<br>
### Indicators
The following indicators can help identify if forces are going on the offensive or on the defensive. These indicators can aid pilots for filling out the After Action Reports
with necessary intelligence that can be valuable for next operations.

- Assembly of Artillery units bigger than artillery battery (3 artillery tubes)
- Assembly of Rocket artillery
- Large formations of utility veichles  ( fueltrucks, ammunition trucks, trucks) close to maneuver battalions.
- RW activity in front of enemy frontline formations (insertion of Recon units)
- Armored units (MBT's) forming up in more than company size
