# Air Doctrine

Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iranian doctrine moved away from a doctrine largely based on western armaments and thought and towards a doctrine of revolutionary enthusiasm and religious ideology. Iranian military doctrine in general centers on asymmetric warfare, and emphasizes the use of geography, strategic depth, and a general willingness to accept losses in the name of jihad as ways to confront technologically advanced adversaries such as the United States and Israel.

Indications are that current tactics and doctrine is largely based on lessons from the Iran-Iraq War from 1980-1988 as well as the American campaigns in Iraq, mainly centered around defense of territorial integrity rather than offensive capabilities.

### Size and Capabilities

<!-- TODO: Align the numbers with the numbers in Enemy.MD  -->
As of 2010, the strength of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) are estimated to be 52,000 personnel, 10 fighter bases, 19 fighter/fighter bomber and training squadrons, 1 reconnaissance squadron, and 10 transport/tanker squadrons

The strength of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air Force (IRGC-AF) is estimated at 5000 personnel. The force structure is unclear, but it includes some ground attack and transport units.

| Aircraft                   | Types                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fighters / Fighter Bombers | F-14A, F-4E, F-5A, F-5E, MiG-21, MiG-29, Su-24M, Su-25T |
| Reconnaissance             | F-4E, Su-24M, Su-25T                                    |
| Transport                  | C-130, IL-76MD                                          |
| Tankers                    | IL-78                                                   |
| Helicopters                | Mi-8M, CH-47                                            |

Iran's most advanced fighter is the MiG-29 Fulcrum, however the IRIAF remains dependent on 1970's U.S. made aircraft like the F-4 Phantom II, the F-14A Tomcat and the F-5 Tiger II. It is currently developing its own derivative based on the F-5A and F-5E Tiger IIs.

Intelligence suggests that Iranian air planners understand the value of airborne early warning and C4I systems, airborne intelligence, electronic warfare platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and airborne refueling. Iran has an active program and possesses reconnaissance, target and lethal UAVs of unknown type and capabilities. The IRIAF's lone airborne early warning and control system (A WACS) platform crashed in September 2009, killing all seven people on board. Iran is also building indigenous precision-guided munitions for the IRIAF, but recent large-scale exercises showed fighters delivering conventional unguided munitions. The Iranian Air Forces are believed to possess MK82 and MK83 general-purpose bombs as well as early AGM-65 Maverick missiles.

### Tactics
Doctrine and tactics are primarily focused on defense of Iranian territory. However, Iran has shown the capability to attack, utilizing large numbers of aircraft to even out technical or strategical disadvantages. Also, common to all is the underlaying ideology of jihad and sacrifice.

Airbases are covering most of the country, with fighters on alert status. Any offensive posture from the IRIAF would see sudden, large numbers of fighters/fighter bombers over a wide front. The goal would be to stretch any inferior-in-numbers enemy air forceâ€™s resources, as well as overwhelm enemy air-defenses.

#### Air-to-Air
The IRIAF tactics are expected to revolve around their F-14As and newer MiG-29s, supported by other airframes like the F-5s utilizing numbers to compensate for their lack of technology. As they are currently lacking Airborne Early Warning and Control systems, air assets are controlled from the ground (GCI), utilizing what is believed to be an extensive radar network.

#### SEAD
While older than their western counterparts, the IRIAF has access to platforms and weapons capable of inflicting damage from farther distances then what western multirole/fighter bombers are currently capable of:

| Designation | Range  | Carried By     | Description                                      |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Kh-25MPU    | 30 nm  | Su-24M, Su-25T | Anti-Radiation Missile                           |
| Kh-31P      | 60 nm  | Su-24M, MiG-29 | High-Altitude, High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile |
| Kh-58U      | 130 nm | Su-24M, Su-25T | Superseded by the Kh-31P, but remains in service |

As the table show, the weapons believed to be in the IRIAF inventory has considerable range claims. Their main SEAD platforms would be the Su-25T, Su-24M and to some degree their MiG-29s. Both the Su-24M and Su-25T also carries the 'Fantasmagoria' target acquisition and ELINT pods.

These aircraft possess no stealth capabilities and standard chaff/flare countermeasure systems. As such, engagements from a stand-off distance with heavy air-cover would be their most likely modus operandi.
