#  Air Defence Doctrine

The Air Defences are operating in accordance with the following Doctrine:


The Iranian's have a well developed Integrated Air Defence System (IADS). The Russians have the last years provided various parts to increse the effectiveness 
of this network. 

The IADS consiste of 2 primary elements. Where one is the A-A fighters located at primary airbases, and the second is the Surface to Air missile's.

IADS consists of Early Warning Radar's (EWR's) that support both elements with early warning.

Around the most critical infrastructure, such as important airbases, a Air Defence Brigade consisting of SA-10 and SA-11 is eastablished to provide necessary area defence to 
protect other parts of the IADS, especially the A-A fighters.

Around key cities or military installations, various fixed sites of larger SAM's such as SA-2, SA-3 and SA-6 is establised.  All static sites is assessed to be protected by
smaller SAM's to prevent low-flying aircraft from attacking the larger SAM's.

For supporting the ground forces, the Iranian primarily uses its Air Defence Battalions of SA-19, SA-13. These battalions are attached to motorized and mechanized infantry regiments.
The Air Defence Revolutionary Guard Battalion's with SA-15 and SA-8 are normally attached to the armored regiments, as these are seen as the most important element of the 
Iranian ground forces.





### Tactics
The Iranian SAM's are reported to use various modes of operandi in order to increase it's lethality and make it harder for the coalition to operate. 
One tactic is to have smaller SAM's shut off, and only turned on when a potential target is in the weapon engagement zone of the SAM. 
The entire network is likely not active at any given time, as the Iranians want to both hide and prevent Anti Radiation Missiles (ARM's) to be able to neutralize their radars.
