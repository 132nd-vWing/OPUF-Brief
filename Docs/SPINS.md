## Aerial Refueling
Tanker instructions

**Altimeter setting.**
Unless otherwise directed an altimeter setting of standard pressure setting (29.92) is to be used for AAR operations.

**Vertical separation.**
Receivers are to join from below and are to maintain a minimum of 1000ft vertical separation (unless otherwise directed by the controlling agency) , until visual contact have been made.

**Clearance.**
Receivers must receive clearance from the controlling agency (AWACS) before contacting the tanker.

**Joining procedures.**
The left side of the tanker is to be used for joining aircraft. The first receiver of a formation may join directly astern the boom, when the receiver has visually confirmed that no refueling is in progress.
