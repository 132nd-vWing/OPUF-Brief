# NOTAM OPUF MSN 18

- Update 1.0

## VUL / Latest landing
- In order to make sure people do not feel that they need to stay up late, and do not get out of the mission due to unfolding events,  VUL times, or latest landing times
are now specified for each flight. This ensures that everyone are able to finish at a reasonable time. It is important that everyone pay attention to the VUL times or 
latest landing times, as they are also used to coordinate the use of other assets (AWACS, JTACs, other flights, etc)
