#  21st Coastal Artillery Battalion (21st CAB)

### BACKGROUND  
The 21st CAB was formed in 1995, little is known about this unit. Intelligense suggest postings here are less popular, presumably because of rumoured mishaps with liquid rocket propellant.


### EQUIPMENT 
* SS-C-2 Silkworm.  
* Radar and Optical ranging EQ.  
* Patrol boats.  
* Utility Vehicles (Land Rovers).  

### COMPOSITION 
A Coastal Artillery Battalion (CAB) consists of two companies with four platoons each. Two battery platoons, one logistics platoon and one reconnaissance platoon.


* **CAB BATTERY PLT.**  
Three sections supporting two launchers each.

* **CAB LOGISTICS PLT**  
Four sections with utility vehicles supporting repositioning and preparation of launch sites.

* **CAB RECONNAISSANCE PLT**  
Four sections normally operating speedboats or UAZ-469 (2x veichles per section) 

 
### TACTICS  
Following based on intelligence from recent desertions.  
* Frequent redeployments to prepared and unprepared sites using Landrover type vehicles.  
* Depending on alert posture one or two of the batteries are erected at the same time.  
* Recon PLT are tasked mostly with local security, including counter-surveillance against the local population.

#### SS-C-2 INFO  
The missile features a round nose accommodating the radar seeker, a pair of mid-mounted delta wings on the middle section of missile body, and three tail control surfaces. The missile is powered by a liquid-fuel rocket motor, with a solid rocket booster attached under the missile fuselage.  
  
The HY-2 is launched from land-based launcher and flies at an altitude of 1,000m during the initial stage of the flight. After the missile switched to the cruising mode, the flight altitude was reduced to 100~300m. During the final stage of the flight, the missile switched on its radar seeker and dives to an altitude of 8m until it hits the target. The single-shot hit probability is estimated to be 90%. Due to its oversized body, the HY-2 did not develop a ship-to-ship variant. The HY-2 was widely exported to the Middle East, and was the missile most associated with the silkworm nickname.
